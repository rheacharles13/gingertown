# GingerTown
# Final Project, Creative Embedded Systems (Fall 2024)
Our final project was building an interactive gingerbread house "village" using two ESP32s, LED lights, buttons, and motion sensors.  The project will emulate two neighbors "speaking" to each other over WiFi by transmitting simple greeting messages when a neighbor "waves" and turning on the porch light when a doorbell is pressed.
